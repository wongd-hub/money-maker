# Auto-timesheet emailer for Hays timesheets

![](https://github.com/wongd-hub/money-maker/blob/main/assets/screenie.gif)

This is a Chrome extension developed to do two things upon opening the Print View of a timesheet:

1. Take a screenshot of the Print View tab
2. Authenticate with Gmail using the Gmail API, and send an email with this screenshot as an attachment

## TODOs:

- Set up the extension popup as an options page
- Set OAuth to persist so that you don't need to re-log in every time
