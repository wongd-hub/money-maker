</p>

1. Take a screenshot of the Print View tab
2. Authenticate with Gmail using the Gmail API, and send an email with this screenshot as an attachment

## Instructions

- Upon installation, open the extension to set your email settings.
- Then open a Hays timesheet in Print View and click the header banner to send an email.
- Authenticate with Gmail and the email will be sent.

## TODOs:

- Set OAuth to persist so that you don't need to re-log in every time
- Create icons
